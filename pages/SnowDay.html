            <h2 class="headline">Snow Day </h2>
            <p> Snow Day is a multiplayer, class-based, snowball shooter game that has many different game modes including Capture
                the Flag and Team Deathmatch for both casual and competitive play. Players can incorporate many strategies
                to achieve victory, including building defenses and utilizing various weapons. </p>

            <h3 class='subheadline'>Controls (Movement and Weapons)</h3>
            <h4 class="section-title">Movement</h4>
            <p>Players have a base movement speed which is modifiable and limited by stamina. To control the character, "WASD"
                (or the left analog stick, if using a controller) can be used to move around. The mouse or the right analog
                stick (in the case of a controller) both control where the character is aiming. Movement includes the ability
                to dodge in left, right, forward, or backward directions based on a simple tap of the "c" key. Dodging reduces
                a player's stamina by two thirds. Sprinting slowly drains a players stamina to zero. When a player has zero
                stamina they must move at the base speed until stamina is regained.</p>
            <h4 class="section-title">Weapons</h4>
            <p>There are a number of different weapons in the game including the snowball (which every character has), the bazooka,
                and the sniper rifle. Every player, on spawn, will have the snowball equipped which can be thrown with any
                power. To build power, the left mouse button or the trigger button on a controller must be held. The snowball
                has a maximum power, as indicated on the UI when it is equipped. Other weapons, like the bazooka and sniper
                rifle, require a fully-charged power bar before the projectile is launched. Every weapon also has a "cooldown"
                period after a projectile has been launched.</p>
            <p>Weapons can be switched using the keyboard or the controller. Every character has a snowball, a secondary weapon,
                and a build tool. The build tool allows the player to place blocks on the level for defense, and is covered
                later in this document.</p>

            <p>Certain weapons use a "homing" feature for their projectiles which is indicated by an orange reticle on the UI.
                The snowballs follow a curved path in attempting to hit the enemy. Additionally, if the reticle is orange,
                a player can lock their reticle onto another player.</p>

            <h3 class='subheadline'>Multiplayer</h3>
            <p>Multiplayer occurs over a network so that players can play with and against other people without having to be
                in the same room. Players can create and join rooms and specify options such as map, game type, victory condition,
                and number of AI players. At the end of each match, every player in that room is returned to a room lobby
                where the host can decide to play again. Players are identified by their username selected upon game load.
                If a username is not selected, a default name of "Player" is assigned.</p>

            <h3 class='subheadline'>Game Modes</h3>

            <h4 class="section-title">Capture-The-Flag</h4>
            <p>Capture the flag pits opposing teams against one another to capture one another’s flag. Player will re-spawn
                after a short duration when knocked out.</p>

            <h4 class="section-title">Team Death Match</h4>
            <p>Team death match consists of opposing teams attempting to reach some predefined victory condition. Score will
                be incremented when one player knocks out another.</p>

            <h4 class="section-title">Domination</h4>
            <p>Domination requires opposing teams to capture up to three points on a map in order to gain points to win. A neutral
                point gives no points to either team; however, when a team takes over a point by physically being on it for
                a short duration, they will take it over and begin to earn points. Opposing teams can take points from one
                another simply by capturing each other's points.</p>

            <h3 class='subheadline'>Re-spawning</h3>
            <p>Upon death or being "knocked out," the player's camera switches to a specific death cam for a short duration
                to indicate that their character has run out of health. Then, the character respawns at one of the spawn
                spots in their base and the player can resume their gameplay.</p>

            <h3 class='subheadline'>Player Health</h3>
            <p>Player health follows a relatively typical configuration for most multiplayer shooter games; that is, being hit
                by another player will lower the health of the player that was hit. When a player's health falls to zero,
                they will die or be "knocked out." The only way to regain health during gameplay is to be hit by a healing
                snowball thrown by a Healer on the same team.</p>
            <h3 class='subheadline'>Building Mechanic</h3>
            <p>Given that the game occurs in areas where there is an abundant amount of snow around, each class will be able
                to build using the snow in some way. In general, the characters can use the snow to lay down blocks, which
                can eventually form things like walls and forts. Blocks can be placed one-by-one, or the player can click
                and drag to create large structures. Building larger structures will take more time to build, but will offer
                a greater strategic advantage. To prevent overuse of the building feature, players have a set number of blocks
                they are able to use. Once they use up these blocks, they must remove old ones to build any more. Some classes
                will have different methods of building, including the Engineer which can build a snowman in addition to
                the normal building tool.</p>

            <h3 class='subheadline'>Classes</h3>
            <p>Players will have the ability to choose a character class at the beginning of each match.</p>

                players play to their gametype (that is, they try to win even in more complicated modes such as Capture the
                Flag and Domination). Additionally, they attempt to intelligently play by hiding behind cover and attacking
                when needed.</p>
            <p>Multiple AI players can be added to a game. They will not attack or damage players on their own team.</p>

                        by. They can either be created by players.</p>
